(node:21304) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/tidyverse/observers/index.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/tidyverse/observers/package.json.
